Polymorphism - Many forms
Dynamic polymorphism

Inheritance - To use already creating stuff into somewhere else after making 
		relationship. 
		In Java that relationship generally happens between two classes 
		using extends keyword.
		Bigger class is called as Parent/Super/Base , smaller is called as
		Child/Sub/Derived.

		3 kinds of Inheritance
			1)Single
			2)Multilevel
			3)Hierarchical

				1)Single - realtionship between two classes
				2)Multilevel - from Parent to Child and from 						Child(Parent) to child  						3)Hierarchical - One base class and rest are 						derived class.


		Can inherit interfaces
		Can inherit abstract classes

		Method Overriding - When we use the method of Base class into child 				    and provide new or addon body.	
				    We should mind access specifier in that case.
					A private/protected can be public
					A public cannot be private or protected	  


Static Polymorphism - mehtod overloading	

to load/reuse the same method again in a same class.For doing that we need to mind
method signature.

	Method Signature :
		1)Number of parameters
		2)Type of parameters
		3)Sequence of parameters
